# Group Project: Team Agreement

The first step in project planning is establishing a Team Agreement. This will be used as the guideline for how your team will collaborate during project week.

Projects are stressful, and can ignite emotions that otherwise wouldn’t be a problem. It’s important that the safety and security of the group comes first, and that an agreement is in place to establish expectations and accountability among the whole group.

## Planning

Schedule a 1-hour meeting for your entire project team.

Use this time to review the Team Agreement requirements below, and establish consensus on how to handle each requirement.

## Deliverable

Start a public-facing GitHub markdown file, and include the following components in your team agreement submission.

### Cooperation Plan

Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

Describe at least:

-   What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
	- Benjamin: Good with scope and concepts, thinking about a part of a program and conceptualizing how each moving piece interacts. (i.e Organization/planning) 
	- Nicholas: A creative soul, good at taking direction, good at getting from A to B. 
	- Christopher: researching and writing content, independent worker. 
	- Eden: A good rubber ducky :) and a persistent googler, good at organization, data analysis. 
-   How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
	- This team seems to have a nice splay of strengths with some overlap that allows us to have all aspects of a project covered, organization, collaboration, and "get stuff done" seem to be our main strengths.  
-   In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
	- Benjamin:  TDD, compartmentalizing, need to work on breaking down the large project into smaller steps. 
	- Nicholas:  TDD, recursive functions, identifying tools/researching/implementing said tools. 
	- Christopher: TDD, recursive functions
	- Eden: TDD, independent work, getting started from the ground up. 
-   Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
	- This team is going to have a lot collaboration and chatting day to day, do a stand up in the morning, a stand up after lunch before resuming work, and a stand up before we "end" the day. Making sure that everyone understands #1 priority, and making sure people know what task they should be tackling. 

> **NOTE**: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.

### Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

Describe at least:

-   What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
	- Just be willing to listen,  you have to be willing to compromise and move forward with the project even if something isn't going exactly how you planned. Just take a few minutes to talk it out, be upfront and honest. We can always communicate and figure stuff out together, we all want this to succeed. 
	- Majority vote (or random number generator to break a tie)
-   What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
	- Sit down and have a chat with that person, ask why the person is taking the control and also ask how the other members of the team can pick up more of the work. This is a stressful time and we need to keep that in mind. Keep a pyschologically safe place :) 
-   How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
	- This project is a great opportunity for all of us to mentor and help each other, we all have different strengths and we can use this week to help each other in areas that they feel less confident, making it so we all come out of this project week as better developers. 
	- Practice the 15 minute rule: if an individual or team gets stuck on a problem for more than 15 minutes, they should reach out for help from other team members or a TA.
-   How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
	- If we feel like someone isn't adequately contributing it's likely because they feel like they can't, so we need to ask why, and give them structure and try to collaborate and help them along into contribution. 
-   How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
	- If we as a group cannot come to an agreement we'll call in a third party (JB or a TA) to help us get to the bottom of the conflict. 

### Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

Describe at least:

-   What hours will you be available to communicate?
	- Slack whenever :D  
	- Eden: 9am-10pm (PST)
	- Nicholas 6am-10pm (tenatively) (PST)
	- Ben: Never sleeps (PST)
	- Christopher: 9am - 10pm (PST)
-   What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
	- Slack and Remo
-   How often will you take breaks?
	- As needed, aim for 10 min every hour. 
	- We're all adults, if you need a break take a break. 
-   What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
	- Work harder
	- pull some later nights
	- scale back MVP
-   How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
	- Slack and Remo as needed
-   What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
	- everyone gets 3 minutes to just talk and say what you need to say during stand ups
-   How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
	- Circling back "everyone gets 3 minutes to just talk" but also know that everyone on the team is willing to listen if someone needs to talk for longer, psychological safety is extremely important for good team environments. 
	- At beginning of morning stand-ups, each team member shares one personal, non-coding related thing about what's going on in their lives at the moment, recognizing this fosters greater understanding and sensitivity for one another.

### Work Plan

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

> **NOTE**: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

Describe at least:

-   How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
	-  We'll be using Jira to create tickets for to-do lists, assign task and track what is done with each task. 
-   What project management tool will be used?
	- Jira 

### Presentation Deck

Make a single copy of the [Presentation Deck Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jmnVceamFG8mUcP_7zaE06Ai_Jpv2nw6Io5my9m9-i0). Share your copy will all team members, so everyone is working from the same file.

Link to the shared doc in your project plan.
[Template for Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CjLz7yP4f8KemD3MzgRg9v2iz7g5wzx8yk8063t9MJU/edit#slide=id.g2accd1c413_3_31)

### Schedule your practice session

Work with your instructor to pre-schedule an date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.

Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:

-   Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
-   When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.
-   Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone”

### Git Process

Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

Describe at least:

-   What components of your project will live on GitHub?
	- Nothing live, we'll use Kaggle for the database
	- The code will be uploaded to GitHub
-   How will you share the repository with your teammates?
	- We made an organization on GitHub
-   What is your Git flow?
	- During standup's we'll all come together and push all the changes that have been made, address any merge conflicts, then pull down fresh up to date versions of the code base
-   Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
    -   How many people must review a PR?
	    - Two
    -   Who merges PRs?
	    - Someone who isn't the original Two approvers
    -   How often will you merge?
	    - During Stand ups (2-3 times a day)
    -   How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
	    - During Stand ups (2-3 times a day)
		    - Or as needed if circumstances change 

## Submitting Your Work

This is a group submission. Only one person must submit for group credit.

Please have everyone’s name at the top of the doc.

Submit a link to your the GitHub markdown file where you have created your Team Agreement.

This step must be completed and approved before proceeding with any project work. Notify your instructor when this is ready for review.
