# Group Project: Begin Wireframes & Software Requirements

## Wireframes

It is now time to begin preparations for your Group Project.

The next step for group projects is to begin to generate wireframes for each page in your application.

### Tasks

Wireframes allow you to experiment with the look and feel of a website without committing any code. Create your wireframe in a digital tool. Whiteboard wireframes will not be accepted.

Provide an image of your wireframes in the readme of your project.

## User Stories

Start out by creating at least 5 user stories for your approved project. The outline/requirements for user stories can be found [HERE](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/projects/UserStories)

Each story in your project management board should contain:

1.  Furthered Learning
2.  As someone who's searching for a job I want to know what technologies are most relevant in job postings, and thus where I should be focusing my learning into. 
3.  Web scraper will grab technology terms from a number of job postings. 
4.  Data scraped from the postings will be posted as a graph to show which terms show up most often. 

1.  Where do I belong?
2.  As someone who's searching for a job I would like to be able to see where to point my job search, based on my current tech stack.
3.  Web Scraper will show the tech terms companies are interested in.
4.  Data scraped will be counted to show how much each term is listed within the set.

1.  Visualization
2.  As a job searcher I'm a lot more visual and would like to see the data within graphs.
3.  Data analysis on the web scraped data to display a graph of the terms grabbed and their relevance. 
4.  Graph of terms and their counts will be displayed in a readable graph. 

1.  Consistency
2.  As someone searching for a job I want to know how frequently the technology desired is changing. 
3.  Perform two scrapes, one at the start of the week and one a couple of days later and compare the patterns
4.  Display two graphs, and show the difference(if any) between the two scrapes. 

1.  Compare Salary to Tech Term (Stretch)
2.  As someone who's searching for a job I'd like to know how salary ranges compare between two tech skill sets. 
3.  Web Scraper will include salary ranges listed on job listing, and data visualization will compare these two columns (tech term and salary)
4.  Graph will display the comparison between tech terms and salary range. 
Provide a link to your project management board that contains your user stories in your project Readme.

## Software Requirements

Using the [Software Requirements Document](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/projects/SoftwareReqs), create a new file within your main GH repo named `requirements.md`. Include in this doc the required information for your software reqs for your project as a whole.

## Domain Modeling

Draw out the entities for your project and how they are related to each other. Determine the relationships between the functions/methods and entities of your app.

Include in your domain model the names and data types of your entities and their properties.

Do some research on domain modeling and create your own diagram that represents your app. Here are some helpful resources as a starting point:

1.  [Brief introduction to Domain Modeling](https://medium.com/@olegchursin/a-brief-introduction-to-domain-modeling-862a30b38353)
2.  [Domain Modeling](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/domain-modeling/)
3.  [Domain driven architecture diagram](https://medium.com/nick-tune-tech-strategy-blog/domain-driven-architecture-diagrams-139a75acb578)

Include this domain model in the `README.md` file located in your project’s GitHub repo.

## Using a Database? Make an Database Schema Diagram

If you are using a database of any kind in your project, draft out what your schema will look like by creating a diagram of all your application data models, each in it’s own collection (or table).

Be sure to identify the relationships (if any) between each of your data models:

1.  Does a single item in your database “belong to” just one other item in your database? For example, a person has one passport, and a passport belongs to a single person.
2.  Does a item in your database “belong to” multiple other items in your database? For example, a house has many residents, and each resident has one primary house.
3.  Do many items in your database relate to many other items in your database? For example, a band has many musicians, and a musician can be in many bands.

Also, include for each seperate collection:

1.  The name of each property stored in the collection.
2.  The required data type.
3.  An indication if this collection is associated with another collection.

Include this diagram in your readme, accompanied by an explanation of each data model and it’s responsibility in the application.

## Submitting Your Work

**This is a group submission. Only one person must submit for group credit**

Submit your project repo with your readme outlined.

Upon completion of your tasks listed above, notify your instructor for approval of the content. After approval, you may begin coding. All 4 project steps **must** be completed before you may start coding your project.
