# Repo and Tooling

Today we will create your project repo and setup your tooling for project management.

## Build your Repo

It is now time to begin preparations for your Group Project. The next step for group projects is to create a repository where you will do your work.

### Tasks

Each group should select a team member to host the project repository. This member should create a new repository and add the other team members as collaborators, so that everyone has the right to manage the repository.

Alternatively, you may create a GitHub “Organization”, add team members as members of the organization, and create the repository there.

The name of the org and the repo should **resume-ready**. Use the app name, the problem domain, or another professional-sounding team name. Don’t call it `201Final` or `project-week-app` or `reeses-puffs` or similar.

> This project may well be a key piece of your portfolio. Potential employers will be looking at this project. Name it accordingly.

Then, complete the following:

1.  Lock down your main branch. Set a restriction on your main branch that PR’s must be approved by someone other than the PR owner before it can get merged.
2.  Create a branch where a test or staging deployment may be made with merged features that may not yet be ready for production
3.  Apply any other relevant safeguards or processes that you mentioned in your Git Workflow from part 1 of your project planning.
4.  Create a basic `README.md` file within your repos that contains the names of all the members as well as a short description of the project.

## PM Tools

Make sure everyone has access and permissions to the PM tooling you are using. Make any appropriate or required associations or connections between Github and your tool.

If you are unfamiliar with any PM tools, here are a few suggestions:

1.  [GitHub Projects](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards)
2.  [SpiceWorks](https://www.spiceworks.com/free-help-desk-software)
3.  [Trello](https://trello.com/)
4.  [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/?nav=min)

## Submitting Your Work

**Only one person needs to submit this assignment for the group to receive credit** In the text area, write the name of your project and provide a link to the repository you have created.

_This assignment will be graded based on your naming of your repo (and org) as described, how it’s configured, and your completeness in following all instructions._
