# Prepare for Projects

For this project, you will be summarizing all of the concepts you’ve learned and applied in labs up to this point of the course. Your instructional team will provide you with further specification regarding constraints and expectations for course-specific requirements.

At this point, you should have an idea as to what’s possible to create given what your course has covered so far and will cover before the start of the project. Use that knowledge to generate some ideas and discussion!

## Project Requirements

Your instructor will provice the detailed requirements for your project, and team tasks.

## Group Project: Pitch Ideas

It is now time to begin preparations for your Group Project. You’ve been given groups, so the first step for group projects is to pitch ideas.

## Tasks

As a group, arrange a 30-60 minute time when you can all be in the same place. Lab time is ideal for this.

There will be two phases for this: brainstorm ideas, and pitching projects.

### Brainstorming Ideas

Grab a whiteboard and brainstorm ideas. During this phase, there is no comment or criticism of ideas. Ideas should be given in the form of titles or very short phrases. If an explanation is needed, save it for the pitch round.

### Pitching a Project

Once a critical mass of ideas has been written down, the person who offered the idea will give a pitch. Each pitch may be no longer than 2 to 3 minutes. The purpose of a pitch is to sell the idea to your group mates. During this phase, questions may be asked, but the discussion should be limited. Keep it short and to the point.

At the end of the pitch, you should have formed a short list of favorites.

## Create your Pitch

Once your team had decided on 1 or 2 favorites, prepare your pitches for submission.

Each pitch should contain the following information:

**_Name of Project_** : Beacon: Shining a Light on your Job Search

1.  Summary of idea.
	1. Create a Web Scraper for a Job posting website, visualize the data that is scraped from the website. 
2.  What problem or pain point does it solve? a. Keep it high level without going into too much detail. (3-4 sentences is enough)
	1. Making job searching more pointed and allowing the appliers to know what technologies they need to learn and play with, what technologies are missing in your resume 
	2. What terms you should put in your resume to get noticed 
3.  Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition.
    -   What is the **minimum** required for you to present on your demo day?
    - 1 Successful Scrape and a good visualization from the Data gathered from that scrape 

## Submitting your work

**Only one person needs to submit this assignment for the group to receive credit**, please include all names of group members in your pitch document.

As a group, agree on 2 top ideas. In a doc, or in the text area submit your top two pitches. The instructional staff will then approve one of your two ideas. Please have your top choice listed first, and second choice listed last.
